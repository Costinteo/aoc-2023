# Advent of Code 2023
My solutions for Advent of Code 2023. This year I'm hoping to learn some Rust with it.  

Come solve the problems yourself: https://adventofcode.com/2023  

## Running solutions

## MIT Licensed

You have to save your session cookie from the site though. Open your network tab in a browser, access the advent of code website, copy your session cookie from the request headers and paste it as ``cookie=STRINGYOUFOUND`` inside ``res/cookie.txt``. Mine is git ignored.
